## Project Overview
This project evaluates how **Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG)** accumulation influences Calgary’s water infrastructure by analyzing:
- The correlation between **restaurant density** and **water main breaks**
- The spatial stress on **sanitary pipes and manholes** in high-density food service clusters
The analysis compares infrastructure vulnerability across communities (CityCenter and Brentwood) and demonstrates how the City can apply **hotspot analysis** to identify areas of elevated FOG discharge. These insights support strategies to **increase compliance** and reduce infrastructure risk by decreasing potential blockages at accumulation points—such as Citycenter where multiple restaurants discharge into the same manholes.
The goal is to inform **targeted compliance strategies** that reduce costly repairs and improve sustainability, aligning with **SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**

## Objective
Assess whether restaurant density correlates with water main break frequency.
Identify sanitary system stress in high-density food service zones.
Highlight limitations in Calgary’s surcharge-based wastewater compliance model.
Advocate for stricter enforcement and proactive measures.
