## Project overview
This project evaluates how **Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG)** accumulation influences Calgary’s water infrastructure by analyzing:
1. The correlation between **restaurant density** and **water main breaks**.
2. The spatial stress on **sanitary pipes and manholes** in high-density food service clusters.
The goal is to identify infrastructure vulnerabilities and inform **targeted compliance strategies** to reduce costly repairs and improve sustainability, aligning with **SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**
## Objective
- Assess whether restaurant density correlates with water main break frequency.
- Identify sanitary system stress in high-density food service zones.
- Highlight limitations in Calgary’s surcharge-based wastewater compliance model.
- Advocate for stricter enforcement and proactive measures.
